## Why AntScopeZ?

AntScopeZ is a fork of RigExpert's own AntScope2 software, renamed and
rebuilt to give it its own identity, separate from the vendor's. Along the
way it's had a steady stream of fixes and new features. -- see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the full
detail.

**This is not an official RigExpert product.** It's an independent,
unaffiliated, community effort -- see the disclaimer in
[README.md](https://github.com/K4HEZ/AntScopeZ#readme) before relying on
it for anything that matters (licensing, firmware updates, warranty
support). For those, use RigExpert's own software -- the original
AntScope2 is available directly from RigExpert at
[rigexpert.com/software/antscope2](https://rigexpert.com/software/antscope2/).

## Supported devices

AntScopeZ isn't limited to RigExpert's own analyzers -- NanoVNA and a
some other brands are supported too. See
[SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md](SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md) for the full list, and its
(Disclaimer: most listed devices haven't been individually tested against
this fork.)

## Getting help

This is a volunteer-maintained fork, not a supported product -- there's
no SLA and no guarantee of a fix or a timely reply. That said,
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/K4HEZ/AntScopeZ/issues) is the right
place to report a bug or ask a question about this fork specifically. For
anything involving RigExpert's own hardware, firmware, or licensing,
contact RigExpert directly -- this project has no connection to them and
no way to help with those.
