# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the version number
below should track `project(VERSION ...)` in `CMakeLists.txt`.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- TDR Measurement dialog run against a NanoVNA-type device could get stuck
  permanently: the progress dialog (frameless, window-modal, Esc disabled)
  never closed and the panel's Scan button never re-enabled, whether the
  scan finished normally or was stopped early -- both NanoVNA completion
  paths skipped the TDR finalize step entirely. No UI recovery once hit;
  had to kill the process.

### Added

- Dev-only: Connect Analyzer's COM list offers a "NanoVNA (dev emulator)"
  entry, pointing at a companion emulator app
  (`~/QT6Projects/NanoVnaEmulator`) over a local pty -- shown only while
  that emulator is actually running (checks for its symlink at
  `/tmp/nanovna-emulator`), invisible otherwise.

## [2.2.3] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- NanoVNA: real 2-port S11+S21 on every scan (was S11-only), plus an
  opportunistic ASCII/binary `scan` fast path when the firmware supports
  it. Not yet validated against real hardware.
- Analyzer scan-timeout watchdog: a scan that goes silent for too long
  (device unreachable, or busy -- already held open by another program or
  another AntScopeZ window) now fails with an error instead of leaving
  the busy indicator/wait cursor stuck forever. Timeout is configurable,
  Settings > General > "Analyzer timeout" (default 8s).
  USB/HID and Serial connections also now detect "device present but
  busy" specifically, both at launch and while polling for a device.
- Analyzer errors now show in a proper non-modal dialog (was a small
  banner too short to hold a real sentence) -- timestamped, includes
  whatever diagnostic detail is available (OS error string, Qt error
  enum, elapsed-silence duration, raw bytes on a CRC mismatch). BLE's
  own connection/protocol errors, previously compiled out entirely
  outside a debug build, are now available at runtime behind Settings >
  Developer > Error Reporting & Logging > "Report Detailed Errors" (off
  by default).
- Help > User Guide: a lightweight, non-modal in-app viewer for
  `docs/user-guide.md` (no HTML rendering engine) -- the guide's own
  self-links (jumping to a section) work.

### Changed

- `SUPPORTED_DEVICES.md` merged into `docs/user-guide.md` as its own
  section, so it's reachable from the in-app viewer above; the
  standalone file/page is gone (index.md, README.md, and the GitHub
  Pages nav all point at the merged section instead).

- Markers table: docked under the plot tabs (a resizable splitter) as a
  normal themed table, instead of a floating semi-transparent popup.
  Visibility now follows the View > Markers Hint checkbox alone --
  toggling it on shows the table (headers only, if empty) immediately,
  rather than only once a marker exists.
- Measurements list: a scan that ends with zero points (cancelled,
  errored, or timed out before anything arrived) is no longer left
  behind as an empty entry.

### Fixed

- File dialogs: "Look in:" now shows translated (es/ja/uk) instead of
  falling back to English -- same class of gap, and same fix, as the
  "Files of type:" label fixed earlier (a corrected-mnemonic override
  shipped alongside Qt's own translation, since Qt's own upstream
  catalog has the same exact-string mismatch for this one too).
- Esc / re-clicking Single or Continuous now actually stops the scan:
  previously, data still arriving from a device with no real wire-abort
  command (e.g. BLE) kept getting processed as if the scan were still
  running -- corrupting whichever measurement was still open, and, for
  Single, repeatedly re-placing the "lowest SWR" auto-marker for every
  leftover point (up to one per free marker slot).
- Continuous mode: stopping it now updates the Measurements list's
  Points column immediately, instead of only catching up whenever the
  next scan happened to rebuild the table.
- A marker placed right as a chart's X axis is still unscaled (e.g. just
  after connecting/reconnecting, before a scan has plotted anything)
  could crash the app on the next click anywhere on that chart.
- App could crash on close after having connected to an analyzer (double
  free of the docked markers table).
- The "Image added to clipboard" notification (Screenshot dialog) was
  unreadable in every theme -- a missing `;` in its stylesheet silently
  dropped the intended text color entirely. Also now follows the active
  theme instead of a fixed dark box.

## [2.2.2] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- Measurements table: Points column now tags each row "(s1p)"/"(s2p)" so
  1-port vs. 2-port measurements are distinguishable at a glance.
- Export dialog: shows the selected measurement's name/points/type, and
  offers new S2P RI/MA/DB Touchstone exports -- real S11/S21/S12/S22,
  only shown for a measurement that actually has 2-port data. The
  existing 1-port S-parameter export also gains a matching S,DB option
  (previously RI/MA only, same as S2P).
- Tools > Marker Comparison: compare two markers' frequency/SWR/return
  loss/R/X, estimated Q and equivalent L/C off the Current marker, and
  estimate how much to trim (or add) to a simple 1/4-wave vertical,
  1/2-wave dipole or full-wave antenna to move resonance from one marker
  to the other.
- Settings > Markers: "Automatically set a marker at the lowest SWR" (Marker
  behavior group, on by default) places a marker at the swept trace's
  lowest-SWR point right after a single/full scan finishes -- never during
  a Continuous scan, and only if a marker slot is free.
- Tools > TDR Measurement: one dialog for both setting up and reading a
  TDR scan (replaces the standalone Single-button-on-the-TDR-tab trigger
  and the separate Tools > TDR Analysis dialog, both retired). Scan
  setup: cable type/velocity factor (genuinely drives that scan's own
  distance calculation, but only for that one scan -- doesn't touch
  Settings > Cable unless applied explicitly, see below), top frequency,
  points, a live unambiguous-range/resolution estimate shown before
  scanning, and a window-function picker (Rectangular/Hamming/Hann/
  Blackman/Kaiser, Hamming default) that re-plots an already-captured
  scan live with no rescan needed. Result (after scanning): distance to
  the strongest reflection, open/short with an approximate impedance in
  Ohms (a rough estimate, not a precision figure), an automatic note when
  a peak falls short of an entered known cable length (possible fault
  partway along vs. just the far end), and a reverse calculator that
  solves for velocity factor given a known physical cable length. "Use
  this velocity factor" copies the solved value into Scan setup's
  velocity factor field and applies it to Settings > Cable as Custom
  (resetting R0/loss to the "Ideal 50-Ohm cable" convention -- 50 Ohm, no
  loss -- instead of leaving whatever a previously-selected Preset's real
  figures were showing), refreshing the TDR chart's distance axis
  immediately. If Settings > Cable happens to already be open, it updates
  live instead of only taking effect the next time the dialog is opened.
  No Continuous mode -- TDR is one scan at a time.
- Settings > Cable: new Preset/Custom toggle. Preset locks velocity
  factor/R0/conductive+dielectric loss/loss units/frequency to whatever
  cableComboBox has selected (so the displayed numbers can never silently
  disagree with the cable name shown); Custom disables the combo and
  hand-edits those fields instead, same as before this existed. Locked
  fields get their own deliberate "read-only" styling (full-contrast text,
  flattened into the dialog background) instead of Qt's normal disabled
  dimming, so they read as "showing a fixed value" rather than "broken".
  This is now the *only* thing that ever disables those fields -- see the
  cableActionEnableButtons() removal below.
- Measurements table: new "Points" column shows the actual number of
  points received for each scan ("--" until it finishes) -- a device
  silently returning fewer points than requested is now visible at a
  glance instead of requiring a debug-log read.
- Settings > General: new "Scanning" group -- "Scanning points maximum"
  sets the Points field/slider's real practical ceiling (50-10000,
  replacing what used to be a fixed, recompile-only limit); "Warn for
  scans above" pops a Cancel-able confirmation before starting a scan that
  requests more points than this; "Analyzer maximum number of points"
  caps how many points a single sweep actually sends to the device --
  requesting more than that transparently splits the scan into several
  sequential sweeps ("stitching") and concatenates the results into one
  continuous dataset. Default 1000/1000/1000 -- the first two match prior
  behavior exactly, but a scan above 1000 points now stitches by default
  rather than needing to be turned on. Applies to Single/Continuous/User
  scans; TDR, Calibration, and S21 are unaffected for now.

- Settings > General: "Allow extended chart zoom" checkbox (off by
  default) lets Ctrl+scroll/Ctrl+`+`/`-` zoom the SWR, Z=R+jX, Z=R‖jX,
  and RL charts' Y-axis past their normal preset floor/ceiling.
- One Fq mode's floating readout gains a second style: double-click it
  (or its alternate) to swap between the original packed 11-field
  technical view and a new plain, resizable dialog showing just SWR as
  one giant bold number ("x.xx:1") with a small "SWR" caption, auto-sized
  to fill on resize -- a glanceable tuning aid readable from across a
  yard. Both styles stay live-updated the whole session regardless of
  which is shown, so toggling never displays a stale value. The chosen
  style is remembered across restarts and tracks the main window's
  minimize/restore state.

### Changed

- Settings > General: "Register application" button and the "Match
  license" groupbox (Register device/Update license/Device info) moved to
  the Updates tab -- they're update/registration-related, not general
  settings. No behavior change, just relocated.
- Settings > General: removed the "Connect analyzer" button (redundant
  with the main window's own Connect Analyzer entry points) and "Open
  'Connect Analyzer' on launch" checkbox (moved to the Connect Analyzer
  dialog itself, next to "Use same selection for future connections" --
  both are about that dialog's own behavior, not general app settings;
  same underlying setting/ini key, so an existing choice carries over
  unchanged).
- Settings > Cable's locked (Preset) fields now show dimmed text instead
  of full-contrast -- the intent was always "flatten into the background
  to read as locked", but keeping full-contrast text while an actually-
  editable field only gets a mild fill tint made locked fields look more
  prominent than editable ones, backwards from what "locked" vs.
  "editable" should communicate. Plain muted text undershot the other
  way (tuned for disabled hint text where illegibility is fine, not a
  value the user still needs to read) and came out too close to its own
  background, so this is a blend 70% back toward full-contrast text
  instead of the theme's muted color as-is.
- Settings dialog's minimum size is now computed from its own layout
  (every tab's real minimum) instead of a hand-picked 550x320 that
  predated several tabs growing past it -- dragging the dialog down to
  its old stated minimum could squash controls unreadable instead of
  actually stopping there.
- Settings > Cable tab reordered to match how it's actually used and how
  the fields are actually consumed by calcFarEnd() (measurements_farend.cpp):
  cable type picker first; velocity factor/R0 joined the former "Cable
  loss" groupbox (renamed "Cable specifications") alongside
  conductive/dielectric loss/units/frequency -- all seven lock together
  under Preset. Cable length moved into "Transmission line options"
  instead (R0/loss/length all only affect anything once Subtract or Add
  cable is selected, but length isn't a property *of* the cable the way
  the other six are, so it stays always-editable regardless of
  Preset/Custom) and now shows its own ft/m unit label that follows the
  app's Metric/Imperial setting, converting the displayed number rather
  than just relabeling it -- previously always feet with no indication of
  that. Transmission line options' three buttons are stacked vertically
  with a plain-English explanation next to each (Do nothing/Subtract
  cable/Add cable). Export/Update graphs left as-is.
- Removed Settings::cableActionEnableButtons() -- a second, older mechanism
  that also disabled cableR0/cableLossComboBox/cableLen/conductiveLoss/
  dielectricLoss/atFq/anyFq whenever Transmission line options was set to
  Do nothing (vs. Subtract/Add), fighting the new Preset/Custom lock for
  control of the same widgets. Editability is now solely a Preset/Custom
  question ("can I change this"), never a Do-nothing/Subtract/Add one
  ("does this currently matter") -- those turned out to be different
  questions that don't need the same answer.
- Consolidated all theme-driven styling into one `Style::globalStyleSheet()`
  applied to the whole app from exactly two places (startup, theme change)
  instead of ~150 scattered per-dialog `setStyleSheet()` calls that could
  silently go stale while a dialog was open across a theme switch. No
  behavior change for a theme picked before opening a dialog; open dialogs
  now restyle live instead of only on next open.

### Fixed

- 2-port Touchstone import: a `Z, RI` 2-port file no longer gets its
  Z21/Z12/Z22 columns silently mislabeled as S21/S12/S22 (different
  physical quantity, not converted) -- now just skipped, same as before
  2-port import existed, rather than shown as wrong data.
- Settings > General's Data Folder "Browse..." button opened a plain file
  picker (Open/Cancel, files selectable, clicking a folder navigated into
  it instead of choosing it) rather than a proper directory chooser --
  FileDialog::getExistingDirectory() never actually set FileMode::Directory
  despite its name. Also folded in ShowDirsOnly/DontUseNativeDialog via
  the same setOptions() call that sets it now, since setOptions() replaces
  the whole flags set rather than merging with prior setOption() calls --
  DontUseNativeDialog was silently getting wiped out by it too.
- Settings > Cable's Export button crashed with no measurement data yet --
  it always passed size()-1 (-1, wrapping to 4294967295 through a quint32
  parameter) as the measurement index to export, an out-of-bounds access
  as soon as Export needed a suggested filename. Now shows a "run a scan
  first" notification instead of opening Export at all in that case.
- m_settingsDialog could go dangling if Settings was closed via the native
  window decoration/Alt+F4 instead of its own Close button -- only that
  button's handler ever nulled the pointer; WA_DeleteOnClose's deferred
  deletion from any other close path left it pointing at a freed object.
  Added the same destroyed()-nulls-the-pointer safety net the newer
  Marker Comparison/TDR Analysis dialogs already had.
- Opening Settings (or pressing Esc) while no scan was running dropped a
  spurious second "lowest SWR" auto-marker on top of the real one --
  both send a blanket "stop measuring, just in case" signal that
  AnalyzerPro::on_stopMeasure() turned into a measurementComplete()
  emission unconditionally, even when nothing was actually measuring.
  That signal is wired to the same handler a real scan's completion uses,
  auto-marker placement included. Now only emitted if a measurement was
  genuinely in progress.
- Presets table (main window) didn't fill its groupbox the way the
  Measurements table beside it does -- AdjustToContents sized it off its
  own column widths (360px) regardless of the ~314px the box actually had
  to give it, and horizontalHeaderStretchLastSection was off, so it fought
  its container instead of filling it. Matched Measurements' proven config
  (AdjustIgnored, stretch-last-section, cascading resizes) and dropped an
  explicit minimumSize that was fighting the new stretch behavior once
  added. Also removed an extra leftMargin/rightMargin layer one level of
  nested layout added around the Presets column that neither the
  Frequency nor Measurements groupbox has, which was the actual source of
  the visibly wider whitespace around Presets' controls.
- Measurements table's "Points" column reverted a finished scan's point
  count back to "--" after closing Settings. Closing it always signals a
  system-impedance change, which rebuilds every existing measurement's
  graphs/data -- the rebuild never restored the point count it briefly
  cleared, even though the underlying data was intact throughout.
- Markers table's Z (Ohm) column occasionally showed a marker's impedance
  doubled up, e.g. "42.93-j11.1942.93-j11.19". Whenever a marker sat
  exactly on a swept frequency point -- always true for an auto-placed
  lowest-SWR marker -- the value got appended twice instead of once.
- Tools > Marker Comparison: pressing Enter in "Current length" closed the
  whole dialog instead of just committing the field -- Close was the
  dialog's only button, so it defaulted to acting as the Enter target.
- "One Fq" mode (set Start equal to Stop, or Range to 0, then Single or
  Continuous) -- a live single-frequency readout that's been reachable
  this whole time, just undocumented: could abort the app outright, could
  silently restart itself in a loop instead of stopping after one
  reading, and left the Measurements panel's Save/Delete/Clear buttons
  disabled even after stopping. Single and Continuous now behave
  consistently (one reading vs. live-until-Esc, respectively) and stop
  cleanly either way.
- Settings > Developer > Custom Analyzer's "Don't restrict frequency"
  checkbox displayed with inverted polarity the first time Settings
  opened (showed checked when frequency restriction was actually still
  active) -- self-corrected after one click, but the initial state was
  backwards.
- Ctrl+0 did nothing on the SWR chart tab specifically -- every other
  chart tab's Ctrl+0 (reset Y-axis zoom to default) already worked.
- Settings > Developer's "BLE Pings" checkbox defaulted to checked, adding
  BLE's once-a-second keepalive noise to every BLE debug-log capture
  unless manually turned off first.

## [2.2.1] - 2026-08-16

### Added

- Settings > Themes: edit any of the 5 built-in themes' colors (window
  background, text, muted text, border, chart background, marker) with a
  live preview, a Default button to restore a theme's original colors, and
  Save/Cancel. Themes can be freely renamed.
- Help > About AntScopeZ now shows a centered build timestamp below the
  version.

### Changed

- View > Theme now offers 5 built-in options (Light/Dark/Red/Green/Blue)
  instead of just Light/Dark; the default theme on first launch is now
  Light instead of Dark.
- Settings > General's old standalone "Chart background" swatch is gone --
  chart background is now part of each theme, set from Settings > Themes.
- "Show Band Name" now defaults to on.

### Fixed

- Switching the active theme from the View menu didn't update the chart
  background or marker colors, or markers already placed on the chart --
  only saving a theme from Settings > Themes did.
- Settings > Themes' color pickers now open with the swatch's current
  color pre-selected.
- The open Settings dialog's own text didn't pick up a newly-saved theme
  until it was closed and reopened.
- Marker table's "Del"/"Marker" column headers never translated, in any
  language, even after a live language switch -- now translate properly,
  and "Del" is a plain "x" (no translation needed) instead.
- Print dialog's three buttons were fixed-size and clipped translated
  text; now resize to fit.
- The window title's "- Analyzer not connected"/connected-device-name
  suffix could get stuck in English (or whatever language was active at
  first launch) forever, even after switching languages -- it was being
  saved and blindly restored verbatim around each language reload instead
  of actually being rebuilt in the new language.
- Brought Ukrainian, Japanese, and Spanish translations up to date with
  everything added since they were last refreshed, including several
  strings found silently untranslated in older, pre-existing entries.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- Menu bar (File/Edit/View/Connect Analyzer/Help), replacing the old button
  row.
- Main window is now a resizable 3-pane layout with a new docked Cursor
  Details panel.
- Help > About AntScopeZ, showing the running app version.
- Settings > Markers: max-markers spinner and a column picker for the
  Markers popup.
- Speed/Accuracy slider under Points, replacing the separate "Measurement
  speed..." dialog.
- Settings > General: "Data folder" field controlling where Save/Export/
  Screenshot dialogs default to.
- Settings' Developer tab: Debug Logging section with per-interface
  (Serial/USB-HID/BLE/NanoVNA) raw TX/RX logging to a daily log file,
  including a filter for BLE keepalive traffic.

### Changed

- Settings > Updates tab: app version info moved to the top; firmware-
  update checks disabled (explained inline) over privacy/security
  concerns with that network call.
- Settings' developer-only tab (now "Custom Analyzer") is always visible,
  with its controls explicitly disabled and marked "under development"
  instead of hidden.
- Renamed the device-picker dialog from "Select device" to "Connect
  Analyzer" for consistency.
- Points is now a plain text field (capped at 1000) instead of a spinner.
- Reworked keyboard tab order to follow the visual layout.
- The Frequency/SWR hint box is now docked in the main window instead of a
  floating popup.
- Save, Export, Print, and Screenshot dialogs now share one default folder
  instead of independent, mostly-unused "last path" settings; default
  filenames improved.

### Fixed

- Duplicate file extensions sometimes appended in Save/Export dialogs
  (e.g. ".asd.asd").
- Measurements/Presets table columns weren't resizable.
- `.deb` packages could depend on themselves, making them uninstallable.
- Disabled Single/Continuous/Full Range buttons ignored the Light/Dark
  theme.
- Some fields had no fill contrast against the dialog background in Dark
  mode.
- Speed/Accuracy slider didn't respond to arrow keys.
- Tab key got trapped inside the Presets/Measurements tables; added Enter
  as a shortcut to load a row.
- Presets table columns now auto-size to content instead of showing a
  scrollbar.
- A stray Windows registry file was written on non-Windows platforms
  during `.asd` file-type registration.
- PDF export sometimes came out as A4 instead of the configured page size.
- Device-screenshot images were off-center or edge-to-edge in PDF export.
- Crosshairs and cursor hints could get stuck, disappear, or not track the
  chart theme across tabs (including TDR).
- The scan-position tick stayed drawn after a scan finished on NanoVNA-
  connected analyzers.
- Poor contrast on the Markers/graph hint boxes against some chart
  backgrounds.
- The graph-hint box flickered at the edge of scanned data and ignored
  its checkbox while Settings was open.
- App icon missing from the About dialog.
- Export dialog missing a Close button.

## [2.1.6] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Clarified project licensing: AntScopeZ is distributed under GPLv3-or-later
  overall; added `THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md` covering every bundled/linked
  third-party component, and credited AntScopeZ's own copyright in
  `LICENSE.txt` alongside RigExpert's original.
- Packaged builds now ship the license/attribution files above instead of
  leaving them source-tree-only.

### Fixed

- Save dialog no longer suggests a double `.asd.asd` filename.

## [2.1.5] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- Fixed a `.deb` install issue that could break other installed Qt
  applications.
- Fixed a crash on first launch after leaving the app on a hidden
  developer-mode tab.
- Fixed a crash when using a custom analyzer profile with a connected
  device.
- Fixed popup positions not saving correctly under non-English languages.
- Fixed the plot occasionally not responding to mouse input right after
  launch.
- Fixed Start/Delete/Clear occasionally becoming unresponsive after
  placing a marker.
- Fixed "Open 'Connect Analyzer' on launch" not fully disabling
  auto-connect when unchecked.

### Changed

- Development builds between releases now report a `-dev` version suffix.

## [2.1.4] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- Renamed the project from AntScope2 to **AntScopeZ** throughout (executable,
  icons, window titles, file associations, and settings location).
- Added a real Light/Dark theme system with a functional theme selector in
  Settings.
- Replaced the Metric/Imperial checkboxes with a single combo box.
- Removed the RigExpert logo from the main window.
- The `.deb` package now bundles its own copy of Qt 6.11 instead of relying
  on the system's Qt.

### Added

- A band selector above the Presets list for quickly setting Start/Stop
  from a named amateur-radio band.
- Settings option to open Connect Analyzer automatically on launch.
- UI languages are now discovered automatically instead of being hardcoded;
  added a Spanish translation.
- User guide documentation for the Customize/custom-analyzer settings.

### Fixed

- Numerous theme and dialog rendering issues (unreadable text, unstyled
  dialogs, Light mode not applying).
- Smith chart and TDR/S21 axis colors now follow the active theme.
- Start/Stop value formatting and out-of-range input handling.
- Several layout issues in Settings and the main window causing overlapping
  controls.
- Translation loading in non-standard build layouts.
- Firmware-update button now works; the update flow saves the downloaded
  file instead of attempting to flash it automatically.
- Tab-click reliability issues near the tab bar.
- Connect Analyzer could open more than one copy of itself, or fail to
  block other windows while open.
- Screenshot dialog image no longer overlaps its buttons.
- Save dialog now suggests the measurement's own name as the filename.
- Minor spelling/translation fixes ("analyser" -> "analyzer").

### Removed

- Vendor auto-update and telemetry checks that contacted RigExpert's
  servers on every launch/connect.
- Dead code paths, unused build options, and unused image assets.
- Bundled sample calibration files (each user now creates their own).

### Known issues

- Print dialog page-size default and Properties layout glitch (Linux).
- Some Qt-provided translations are incomplete (e.g. Spanish file-dialog
  strings).

## [2.1.3]

Baseline — changelog tracking starts here. See `git log` for history prior
to this point.
